//! Discovery, adoption and event fan-out for the shared OpenCode service.
//!
//! OpenCode is not a per-workspace server. One background process, started by
//! whoever needed it first — usually the user's own TUI — serves every
//! workspace, because a session carries its own `location.directory` and the
//! service itself sits in `$HOME`. Michelle therefore *finds* that process
//! through its registration file instead of owning one, and multiplexes every
//! Michelle task over the single `GET /api/event` stream it exposes.
//!
//! Three rules make that safe, and all three are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **An adopted service is never killed.** Teardown cancels the SSE socket
//!   and returns. Michelle never signals the pid, never calls the service's own
//!   stop route, and never runs `opencode service stop` — the process it
//!   found may be driving the user's terminal, and a process Michelle started with
//!   `serve --service` is indistinguishable from one it found.
//! * **The registration file is opened read-only, always.** The service polls
//!   its own descriptor every 5s and self-terminates when the contents change,
//!   so any write — including a well-meaning repair of a stale descriptor —
//!   kills the user's daemon within 5s.
//! * **The reader thread is leaseless.** It holds the hub, the stream control,
//!   an [`Endpoint`] snapshot and a `Weak<OpenCodeService>` it upgrades
//!   briefly; it must never hold a strong handle. An SSE stream only ends when
//!   the connection dies, so a strong handle there would make the parked and
//!   torn-down paths unreachable — the reader would keep itself alive forever.
//!
//! Demultiplexing is a security boundary rather than an optimization: the one
//! stream carries the user's own TUI sessions and every other Michelle task, so a
//! frame reaches exactly the subscriber that owns its session id, the whole
//! `tui.*` remote-control family is dropped, and anything Michelle does not own is
//! dropped too. See [`route`].
//!
//! Everything here blocks — file reads, HTTP, thread parks — so every caller
//! must already be off the UI thread. Driver start and the daemon's request
//! threads are.
