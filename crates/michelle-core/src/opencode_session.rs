//! Cold-path OpenCode helpers: the resume catalog, transcript import,
//! conversation forking, and the model/agent catalog.
//!
//! Everything here goes through [`opencode_service::attached`], never
//! [`opencode_service::shared`]. Opening the Resume picker or refreshing the
//! model catalog must not start the user's background daemon, so an absent
//! service is an empty catalog — not a spawn, and not a 20s start poll.
//!
//! Every call blocks on a socket, so every caller must already be off the UI
//! thread; one of these is several frames of budget.
//!
//! Three traps are encoded here rather than left to callers:
//!
//! * `GET …/export?sanitize=true` is a SHARE sanitizer, not a state stripper.
//!   Verified against a live service: it replaces the user's prompt, the
//!   assistant's prose, reasoning, tool input, tool output and tool metadata
//!   alike with `[redacted:…:msg_…]` placeholders, so importing a sanitized
//!   export yields a transcript of nothing but placeholders. Michelle exports
//!   unsanitized and drops the private parts itself — see
//!   [`strip_provider_state`].
//! * One agent STEP is one assistant message. A three-tool turn is four
//!   assistant messages (three `finish: "tool-calls"` then one
//!   `finish: "stop"`), so the import folds a turn's assistant messages into
//!   a single visual reply.
//! * One user message is not one turn. A steer is stored as an ordinary
//!   `user` message inside the turn it steered, so turns are counted by
//!   [`TurnBoundaries`], never by user messages.
