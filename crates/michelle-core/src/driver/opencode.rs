//! OpenCode sessions over the one adopted background service.
//!
//! Everything structural about this driver follows from a single fact: Michelle
//! does not own an OpenCode process. `opencode_service` finds the daemon the
//! user's own terminal already started, and every Michelle task rides the one
//! `GET /api/event` stream it exposes. Dropping a driver unsubscribes and
//! sends `Shutdown`; the worker releases its optional Computer Use attachment
//! without terminating or reconfiguring the user's OpenCode service.
//!
//! Commands and events land in ONE worker thread driven by
//! `crossbeam::select!`, so all mutable stream state is thread-local, and
//! context windows come from the service-level catalogue cache rather than a
//! per-session poller.
//!
//! Three traps are encoded here rather than left to a reader to remember:
//!
//! * **The execution outcome is the settle point.** `session.execution.`
//!   `{succeeded,failed,interrupted}` ends the turn and emits exactly one
//!   `TurnFinished`; settling is idempotent, so a steered second message —
//!   which joins the running execution rather than starting its own — still
//!   settles once. Do NOT wait for `session.idle`: the service never publishes
//!   it (the schema keeps it only as a deprecated entry, and a live turn's
//!   stream ends at `session.execution.*`), and waiting for it pins every
//!   finished turn to Working forever. A prompt whose HTTP call fails settles
//!   the turn itself, because no execution ever starts.
//! * **A stream break is never `ProcessExited`.** For an adopted service that
//!   would kill a perfectly healthy session every time the socket blinked.
//!   Reconnection is the service's job and arrives here as `HubFrame::Resync`.
//!   Nor is a shutdown the end of a turn: the service keeps the run's claim
//!   and resumes it as it boots again, with no `idle` marker in between, so
//!   the turn stays open across the restart (see `reconcile`).
//! * **`always` never goes on the wire.** An `always` reply writes into
//!   `/api/permission/saved`, a GLOBAL store shared with the user's terminal
//!   and every other workspace, so durable choices stay in this driver's own
//!   state and every provider reply is one-shot. See `driver::support`.
//!
//! Everything in this file blocks on sockets and runs on the worker thread or
//! a daemon request thread. Nothing here is reachable from a frame.
